### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an MSEE student and a software engineer. I made this account to share some of the electronics
projects I'm working on. Most of these projects are a result of "I want to learn X, Y, and Z, so
I'm going to make something random that needs X, Y, and Z." Hopefully other people will find these
helpful&emdash;though fair warning: much of what I've learned, especially when it comes to printed
circuit board design, is from trial and error. So, I can't guarantee anything here is idiomatic,
safe, or, you know, *good*.

All of these projects are open source; license files are included in each repo. Hardware is licensed
under the TAPR OHL and firmware/software under the GNU GPL.

If you'd like to contact me, you can reach me at my username at Gmail.

My profile picture is ~~shamelessly ripped off from~~ by the lovely and talented Budi Satria Kwan, AKA
radiomode.
