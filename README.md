### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an MSEE student and a software engineer. I made this account to share some of the electronics
projects I've done. Hopefully they'll be helpful to other people, though fair warning: much of
what I've learned, especially when it comes to printed circuit board design, is from trial and
error. I can't guarantee anything here is idiomatic or, you know, good.

If you'd like to contact me, you can reach me at my username at GMail.
